Infinite-degree rational Bézier curves in [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/)

![Curves Demo](Artwork/curves-demo.apng)

This tool was created as a testing ground to explore Bézier curve implementations to be used in [Reform](https://www.github.com/m-o-marmalade/reform). Only a small subset of the functionality of this tool is currently included in Reform, so this tool is public in the meantime.
