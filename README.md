# Curves

Infinite-degree, pixel-perfect, weighted Bézier curve editor. Written in Lua using the [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/products/renoise) Tool API for the purpose of exploring Bézier curve implementations to be used in my other project; [Reform](https://www.github.com/m-o-marmalade/reform).
