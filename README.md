# Curves

Infinite-degree, pixel-perfect, weighted Bézier curve calculation and rasterization. Written in Lua. Demonstration running in the digital audio software, [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/products/renoise).

This tool was created as a testing ground to explore Bézier curve implementations to be used in my other project; [Reform](https://www.github.com/m-o-marmalade/reform). Only a small subset of the functionality of this tool is currently included in Reform. Once the full functionality is implemented in Reform, I may take this repo down.
